This release brings token optimization and MCP Structured Output support, making Repomix more efficient and reliable for AI integration!

## What's New ðŸš€

### Automatic Base64 Data Truncation for Token Savings (#733)
The new `truncateBase64` option automatically shortens long Base64-encoded data like embedded images.

```bash
# Enable the option
repomix --truncate-base64

# Enable in config file
{
  "output": {
    "truncateBase64": true
  }
}
```

This feature significantly reduces token usage when processing repositories containing data URI images and other binary data.

- Data URI: `data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAAB...`
- Base64 strings: `VGhlIHF1aWNrIGJyb3duIGZveCBqdW1w...`

Special thanks to @hand-dot for this contribution! ðŸŽ‰

### MCP Structured Output Support (#719)
Now supports the MCP [Structured Output specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/tools#output-schema).

- Tool outputs are now strictly defined with JSON Schema, ensuring AI models can parse structured data reliably
