This release introduces token count analysis tools and MCP server enhancements, making it easier to analyze and optimize your codebase processing.

## What's New ðŸš€

### Token Count Summarization (#747)
Added the powerful `--token-count-tree` option that displays token usage in a hierarchical tree view! This feature helps identify which files and directories consume the most tokens, making it easier to optimize your Repomix output.

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree
```

Displays a tree structure showing token usage:
```
ðŸ”¢ Token Count Tree:
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json (177 tokens)
â”œâ”€â”€ typos.toml (80 tokens)
â”œâ”€â”€ vitest.config.ts (89 tokens)
â”œâ”€â”€ .agents/ (2874 tokens)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ rules/ (2874 tokens)
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ base.md (1988 tokens)
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ browser-extension.md (453 tokens)
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ website.md (433 tokens)
```

You can also set a minimum threshold to only show files above a certain token count:
```bash
repomix --token-count-tree 1000
```

Special thanks to @gudber for this incredibly useful feature!

### MCP Server: Attach Packed Output Tool (#756)
Added the `attach_packed_output` tool to the MCP server, enabling AI assistants to import and analyze previously generated Repomix XML files.

This tool accepts either a directory containing `repomix-output.xml` or a direct path to an XML file, providing the same structured analysis capabilities as freshly packed repositories without the need to reprocess the codebase.

Special thanks to @petrarca for this valuable MCP enhancement!

## How to Update
