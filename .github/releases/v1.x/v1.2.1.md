This release focuses on critical performance improvements and memory management optimization for large codebases.

## Improvements ⚡️

### Memory Management & Performance Optimization (#749, #748)
Comprehensive memory management overhaul for better performance with large codebases and long-running processes. Particularly beneficial when using Repomix as a library in applications that process multiple repositories.

- Worker process isolation: All heavy operations (file search, processing, metrics calculation) now run in isolated child processes to prevent memory accumulation
- Comprehensive resource cleanup: Improved worker pool management and automatic resource disposal across all operations

### Error Handling Improvements (#739, #746)
Enhanced error handling and performance optimizations to improve reliability:
- Better error messages and debugging information
- Improved template compilation error handling for large files

## How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```
