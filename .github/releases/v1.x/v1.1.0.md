This release brings **Bun runtime support** to Repomix!

## What's New ðŸš€

### Bun Runtime Support (#716)
Repomix now officially supports Bun runtime! You can now use `bunx repomix@latest` to run Repomix with Bun's superior performance.

```bash
# Run with Bun
bunx repomix@latest

# Or explicitly with bun command
bun --bun repomix@latest

# Traditional: Run with Node.js
npx repomix@latest
```

We've also migrated from Piscina to Tinypool for worker thread management, achieving a 700KB reduction in bundle size while maintaining full API compatibility and performance.

## How to Update

```bash
# With npm
npm update -g repomix

# With Bun
bun add -g repomix
```
