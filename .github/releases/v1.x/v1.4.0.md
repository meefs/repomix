This release introduces git commit history integration and enhanced binary file detection, making Repomix more informative for AI analysis and user visibility!

## What's New 🚀

### Git Commit History Integration (#793)
Added the powerful `--include-logs` option that includes git commit history in the output to help AI systems understand development patterns and file change relationships.

```bash
# Include last 50 commits (default)
repomix --include-logs

# Include specific number of commits
repomix --include-logs --include-logs-count 10

# Via configuration file
{
  "output": {
    "git": {
      "includeLogs": true,
      "includeLogsCount": 25
    }
  }
}
```

### Binary File Detection Reporting (#752, #798)
Repomix now reports files detected as binary by content inspection, providing better visibility into excluded files.

```
📄 Binary Files Detected:
─────────────────────────
3 files detected as binary by content inspection:
1. config/corrupted.txt
2. data/malformed.json  
3. logs/output.log

These files have been excluded from the output.
Please review these files if you expected them to contain text content.
```

This helps users understand why files with text extensions might be excluded when they contain binary data.

Example URLs with preset configurations:
- https://repomix.com/?format=markdown&include=**%2F*.ts&ignore=**%2F*.test.ts
